# Python Dependencies + Installation Instructions

This project requires the following Python packages to reproduce the database ingestion, data transformation, and visualization steps.

Dependencies:
-------------
pandas                  # used to read CSV files and process tabular data
mysql-connector-python  # used to connect to MySQL and insert/query data
matplotlib              # used to generate visualizations

(Optional packages – include only if used in your scripts)
---------------------------------------------------------
seaborn                 # statistical visualizations (optional)
sqlalchemy              # alternative DB connector (optional)

Installation:
-------------
Install all required packages in one step using the provided requirements.txt file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If installation fails due to missing MySQL client libraries, install MySQL Connector manually:

    pip install mysql-connector-python

Verifying installation:
-----------------------
Run the following commands in a Python shell to ensure required modules are available:

    import pandas
    import mysql.connector
    import matplotlib

If no errors appear, the environment is ready for project execution.

Notes:
------
- Python 3.8+ recommended
- Installation assumes pip is correctly configured in PATH
- All scripts in the /scripts directory require these packages
